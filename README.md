# tui

**TUI** a beautiful NZ native bird - but also a technical user interfacce. 

This is a fairly basic UI designed for medical image analysis. 
It leverages mostly VTK and ITK for back end algorithms. 
But also includes a number of unique segmentation routines. 

A major distinction from Slicer3D/MITK etc is simplicity and simple customisation. 

If you have a work flow to apply to your study images, then this application will allow you to quickly set buttons and shortcuts to achieve this.
